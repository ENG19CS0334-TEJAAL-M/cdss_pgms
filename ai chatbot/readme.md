A chatbot is a service that people interact with via a chat interface. You can ask questions using your voice or by typing in the same way you would ask a person. The chatbot will usually respond in a conversational style, and it may carry out actions in response to your conversation (for example, order something for you).


### To make the message understandable for a chatbot, NLP proceeds five main steps:
### 1.Lexical analysis
### 2.Syntactic analysis (parsing)
### 3.Semantic analysis
### 4.Discourse integration
### 5.Pragmatic analysis
